The Thirsty Crow
After flying a long distance, a thirsty crow was wandering the forest in search of water. Finally, he saw a pot half-filled with water. He tried to drink from it but his beak wasn’t long enough to reach the water inside. He then saw pebbles on the ground and one by one, he put them in the pot until the water rose to the brim. The crow then hastily drank from it and quenched his thirst.

Moral of the story:

If there’s a will, there’s a way. Every problem has a solution if we just look hard enough and don’t give up.
The command to list all branches in local and remote repositories is:

$ git branch -a

If you require only listing the remote branches from Git Bash then use this command:

$ git branch -r

You may also use the show-branch command for seeing the branches and their commits as follows:

$ git show-branch
