The Cat and the Bone
Once there was a dog who wandered the streets night and day in search of food. One day, he found a big juicy bone and he immediately grabbed it between his mouth and took it home. On his way home, he crossed a river and saw another dog who also had a bone in its mouth. He wanted that bone for himself too. But as he opened his mouth, the bone he was biting fell into the river and sank. That night, he went home hungry.

Moral of the story:

If we always envy what others have, we’ll end up losing what we already have, just like the greedy dog.

The command to list all branches in local and remote repositories is:

$ git branch -a

If you require only listing the remote branches from Git Bash then use this command:

$ git branch -r

You may also use the show-branch command for seeing the branches and their commits as follows:

$ git show-branch
